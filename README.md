# FileWizard

The tool will organize files in the directory and its subdirectories based on their file type and move them to the appropriate folders.

## Customization

The `file_categories` dictionary can be customized to include additional categories and file extensions as needed. Note that the script is designed to organize files by extension, so it may not work well for files with complex or non-standard file names.

## Contributing
